# Directory Tree Generator
A Program to generate a directory tree which allows users to see relationship between all of the files/directories in that tree and to search for a file in a given directory.
Python with tkinter is used for user interface.

## Features

1. User interface has a unique and clean look to it.
2. User can give address or browse though directories to input direrctory.
3. In the generated tree each level is shown with its unique colour and proper indention.
4. After giving the address of a particular directory, a file can be searched using its name.
5. Image of the generated tree can be saved as a jpg or jpeg file, for this PIL is used.
6. Choice of dark and light theme and a sperate clear botton to erase tree is also implemented. 

This is how it looks..
